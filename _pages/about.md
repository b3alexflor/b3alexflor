I am a Masters Student in the Applied Economics 4+1 program with the University of San Francisco, where I help advance financial literacy through Bloomberg and FactSet training while supporting the Silk Family Investment Institute's growth. As a co-author of a research commentary in the Stanford Economic Review, my work addresses climate change's economic impact.

I founded Cognitio Economica, a competitive economics club, and run Alex Flores Media, where I blend entrepreneurship with media production to deliver branding and marketing solutions. I am also passionate about mentoring first-generation students and applying my technical skills in game development and financial analysis. Always open to new opportunities to expand my skills and knowledge.
